# TaskMaster
##### A playful, fully-integrated task manager

## A task manager? Really?

Yes! There are a number of reasons for this:
1. Most native task managers try to integrate but are proprietary enough that they won't work with cross-company platforms
2. Most non-native task managers try to focus solely on fun OR integration, not allowing for a mix of game-ification and fully functional integration.
3. Because I, personally, want to build one to match my personal needs.
